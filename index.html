				<h5>18 year old Georgia has helped to care for her mother for the past 10 years. Her mother has a personality disorder and a physical disability. . Georgia thinks that her caring responsibilities have increased with age as her mother has become more dependent on her, particularly about decision-making, which she finds very stressful. Georgia recently left home to start a medical degree at a nearby university where she is thriving on new challenges and making new friends. Her degree choice was greatly influenced by her experiences as a carer because she had had frequent contact with doctors, not all of it good, but she is determined to make a difference to the lives of others.</h5>

				<h5>Daniel, aged 18, lived up until recently with his parents, older brother and
					younger sister. He is enjoying studying at university although he likes to return home
					on a fortnightly basis. He has helped to care for his sister since he was aged 12 years. She has autism, Asperger Syndrome and learning difficulties. Due to the presence of other family members, responsibility for supporting his sister has been shared and this has made it much easier for Daniel to move away to university and hold down a part-time job. Daniel does not think his school life or health have been negatively affected by caring although he has found his sister’s mood swings and behaviour quite difficult to cope with at times. Of all the caring tasks Daniel does for his sister he would prefer not to give her medication as he worries about the responsibility.</h5>

				<h5>Ella, aged 20, lives with her mother who has suffered with ME for the past
						12 years. Although Ella is one of several siblings, it is she who has assisted with
						the care of her mother and her sister since she was 8 years old. Ella thinks caring resulted in her maturing early and has helped her understand the impacts of disability and discrimination. Because Ella’s mother employs her own carers, Ella’s main caring responsibilities are to assist with shopping, as well as provide companionship and support for her mother with other daily living activities. Ella was a high achiever at school. She is now employed as a nursery nurse and intends to qualify as an early years practitioner. Her strong desire to work with children, a lack of self-confidence coupled with anxiety about leaving her mother, all influenced her decision to turn down
						a scholarship at a university outside her hometown.</h5>

				<h5>David is an 18 year old young man currently employed in a warehouse job
					on a temporary basis. He lives with his parents, younger brother and sister.
					Aged 13 years, David took on caring responsibilities for his mother after she suffered
					a stroke and seizures. She was left unable to walk and relied heavily on David for domestic help, personal care and to look after his siblings as David’s father was working long hours. David thinks that because of caring he has learnt to cope with difficult situations and he has consequently matured. The downside of caring was that his schooling suffered due to a high level of absences and this factor coupled with his dyslexia, meant he did not achieve academically, which he regrets.
